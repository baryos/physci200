    "\n",
    "Time:  Tues 12-2, Thurs 12-2 \n",
    "Location:  LS 2320\n",
    "\n",

    "Instructor: Roy Wollman (rwollman@ucla.edu) \n",
    "Teaching Assistant: Thomas Underwood (tomunderwood@ucla.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "Office Hours: Roy -  Thu 2-3 (by appointment). \n",
    "              Thomas - Thu 4-5 or by appointment\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes \n",
    "The world has changed. Over a year ago, AI capable of coding and performing data analysis problems was developed and released to the public (ChatGPT, Google Bard, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this class is to equip students with knowledge and skills in using AI systems to perform data analysis and visualization tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cursor\n",
    "You will need a subscription for Cursor (https://cursor.sh/). It costs $20/month, which will cost $60 for the entire class. Sorry about that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cursor is a coding environment with AI integration that completely changes how we code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "General purpose analysis programming language with lots of scientific tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda\n",
    "You will use the package manager to download additional software tools that extend what you can do with Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Github\n",
    "A tool to share code. We will use it throughout the class to send you updates on the notebook we will use. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class format\n",
    "The class format is “problem-based learning.” Your goal is to solve 5 problems you will be asked to solve in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to each problem assignment, I will go over a similar problem in class, line by line, to explain how such a problem can be solved and use figures and examples to demonstrate different aspects of the methodology we’ll use. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of each meeting during the “work in class” portion of the time, I will share “hints” and code that will allow you to continue to make progress on these problems and avoid getting “stuck,” i.e., the longest time you would be “stuck” is one lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems we’ll tackle: \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem #1 - Data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem #2 - Hypothesis testing - parametric, non-parametric, and permutation-based approaches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem #3 - Statistical models - linear regression and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem #4 - Dimensionality reduction and clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem #5 - Machine learning and classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading: \n",
    "100% participation in work-in-class sessions. Thomas and I would evaluate your EFFORT in tackling these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default grade is A+, and I expect most of you (likely all of you…) will get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not coming to class or coming to class and chatting and distracting others could reduce your grade. \n",
    "\n"
